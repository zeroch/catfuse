# catfuse
It is a project to use fuse library to implement a replicate photo file system.
 

*Comment:
settimestamp function is not implemented yet so there will be warning when touching files.
real files are saved in /tmp/ directory currently
Connection to database are supposed to be added after file writing currently, I think it is easier to write than writing a seperate 'push' command for it.
